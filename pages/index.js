            I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned JS developper based in Mexico. I'm a self taught developper so, by any
            means I'm a master at it, still/always learning and passionate about it. I enjoy solving all kinds of
            problems and meeting new people from different cultures. I can speak Spanish, French, English and basic
            Portuguese.
